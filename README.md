# üìß Spam Message Classifier using Machine Learning (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)

This project is a simple yet effective spam message classification system using classical machine learning techniques. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and a logistic regression model to identify whether a message is **spam** or **safe (ham)**.

---

## üîß Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text preprocessing  
- **Logistic Regression** for classification  
- **SMOTE** for balancing the dataset  
- **Confusion Matrix** for model evaluation  
- **Interactive CLI-based Predictor**  
- Ready for extending with other models like RandomForest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks

## üöÄ How to Train the Model
Run the training script:
```bash
python Train_Model.py

Loads and cleans the dataset (SMSSpamCollection)

Balances it using SMOTE

Trains a logistic regression model

Saves the model and vectorizer to the Model/ directory

Generates and saves a confusion matrix plot as Confusion_Matrix.png


üîÆ How to Predict
Run the prediction script:

```bash
python Read_And_Predict.py

Enter Text To check: "Congratulations! You've won a prize!"
Predicted Model: ((Congratulations Youve won a prize)) is = Spam
