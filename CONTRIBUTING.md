# Welcome to the Spam-Safe-Model Wiki!

## Overview
Spam-Safe-Model is a machine learning based spam detection system designed to help protect messaging platforms from unwanted and malicious spam. It combines linguistic analysis and behavioral heuristics to classify messages efficiently.

## Features
- High accuracy spam classification
- Lightweight and fast performance suitable for real-time use
- Easy integration with various messaging platforms
- Customizable filters and thresholds

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AUX-441/Spam-Safe-Model.git
    ```
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Train.py program:
    ```bash
    python Train.py
    ```

4. Run the Test.py program:
    ```bash
    python Test.py
    ```

## How It Works
The model processes input messages using trained algorithms to determine whether the content is spam or safe. It uses a dataset of labeled messages and updates predictions based on linguistic patterns and message metadata.
